# IdeaBot
### Objective📓:
We aim to ease the process of developing a project by providing the users the perfect tech stack for their individual ideas tailored to their capabilities.
The problem we are aiming to solve🤔:
We aim to solve the problem faced by the users in manually searching for and discovering the technical specifics and libraries which would be necessary to implement their ideas. Our goal is to substantially reduce the time wasted by users in understanding the optimum technologies they would have to use to bring their projects to life.

### Novelty of our project✨:
Our project provides a unique solution to the problem faced by users in identifying the tech stack required for the given idea.
### Tech Stack👨‍💻:
*	HTML
*	CSS
*	SCSS
*	Django
*	NLTK
*	SKLearn

### Implementation:
We will get the idea,to be worked upon by the user. Then we will use natural language processing to understand the idea in the form of text and figure out the technical libraries/frameworks/modules/technologies best suited for the given idea.
### Future Scope🚧:
Apart from offering the best tech stack suited to the user, we would provide a curated list of all the free and paid resources to learn the specific tech stack and collaborate with educational platforms.
### Business Model:
Our revenue sources to maintain and constantly update IdeaBot would be paid advertisements and user donations.
